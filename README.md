# s4tanic0d3
After more than 10 years I decided to write a new Crackme challenge. The binary contains some tricks, with some revivals from old sk00l era :) I wrote it in assembly, and I'll publish the full source code in about a month ^^ If you find it interesting and you want to write a tutorial, I'll be happy to add the link to your tutorial in this page. Enjoy!

## Requirements
The program runs only on 64-bit systems

## Description
Difficulty: Medium/High

You can download the binary from: https://github.com/enkomio/s4tanic0d3/releases/tag/1.0 (SHA-1: 3F73CF764F1E84DECCF85B902C71722D2230A0C5)

### Goals: 
* Find a valid ID/License pair
* Write a license generator


#### Updates:
2020/10/30 - Updated binary to fix an issue in case of invalid license
