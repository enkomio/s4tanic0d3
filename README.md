# s4tanic0d3
After more than 10 years I decided to write a new Crackme challenge. The binary contains some tricks, with some revivals from old sk00l era :) I wrote it in assembly, and I'll publish the full source code in about a month ^^ If you find it interesting and you want to write a tutorial, I'll be happy to add the link to your tutorial in this page. Enjoy!
